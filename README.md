# dotfiles

My dotfiles to manage my configuration.

## Usage

The install scripts are made for MacOS.

First run `sudo ./sudo_install.sh` (don't trust anyone, check what's in the script before) to:
* Add some MacOs custom configuration

Run `./install.sh` to:
* Install Homebrew
* Install some brew packages
* Install OhMyZsh
* Copy dotfiles
